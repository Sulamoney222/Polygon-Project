    ans: `Polygon zkEVM is the leading zero knowledge scaling solution thatâ€™s equivalent with the Ethereum Virtual Machine, this means that most of the existing smart contracts, developer tools, and wallets work seamlessly.
     Polygon zkEVM harnesses the power of ZK proofs to reduce transaction cost and increase throughput, all while inheriting the security of Ethereum L1.`

    ans: `1- Ethereum-equivalence: Most Ethereum smart contracts, wallets, tools, etc. work on Polygon zkEVM seamlessly.
2- Inherits Ethereum security
3- Lower cost compared to L1 and better finality than other L2 solutions like Optimistic Rollups
4- ZKP-powered scalability, and aiming at similar throughput to PoS`
